## Context

In the past, building high-quality mobile apps required a lot of time and money because writing apps
for different platforms like iOS and Android required specialized programmers who could build and
maintain multiple codebases.

Over time, however, new technologies emerged that made it easier for companies to build and
maintain mobile applications using familiar syntax. One of these technologies is React Native, a
framework for building Android and iOS apps that only requires one codebase.

For this Achievement’s project, I used React Native, Expo, and Google Firestore Database to build a
chat app.


## Technical Requirements

* The app is written in React Native.
* The app is developed using Expo. 
* Chat conversations messages stored in [Google Firestore Database](https://firebase.google.com/).
* The app authenticate users anonymously via Google Firebase authentication.
* Chat conversations must be stored locally.
* The app must let users pick and send images from the phone’s image library.
* The app must let users take pictures with the device’s camera app, and send them.
* The app must store images in Firebase Cloud Storage.
* The app must be able to read the user’s location data.
* Location data must be sent via the chat in a map view.
* The chat interface and functionality must be created using the Gifted Chat library.
* The app’s codebase must contain comments.

### The app is styled according to the given screen design:

* Vertical and horizontal spacing: evenly distributed
* App title: font size 45, font weight 600, font color #FFFFFF
* “Your name”: font size 16, font weight 300, font color #757083, 50% opacity
* “Choose background color”: font size 16, font weight 300, font color #757083, 100% opacity
* Color options HEX codes: #090C08; #474056; #8A95A5; #B9C6AE
* Start chatting button: font size 16, font weight 600, font color #FFFFFF, button color #757083
